# Biblical Symbolism

## The Problem with Precedents

* Part of the challenge with arriving at Biblical symbolism that I like is I have few if any precedents that I have liked

### Precedents

#### C.S. Lewis

* Narnia
  * There's always been a tone in Narnia that I have disliked, though I don't know if any of the symbolism is responsible for that
  * Aslan is likely the greatest Christ character in fantasy literature
  * At times Narnia does become a little too allegorical for me
