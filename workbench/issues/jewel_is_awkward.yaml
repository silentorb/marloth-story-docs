key: jewel_is_awkward
---
I have a lot of great story ideas that involves Nivana's sister, Jewel, but all my ideas for jewel's personality have felt flat.

I've considered making Adelle Nivana's sister but that conflicts too much with Book1 and being a Mediev is too defining of a mold that Adelle doesn't quite fit.
