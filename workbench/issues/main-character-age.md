# Main Character Age

Here's the list of child characters carried over from the first book:

* James
* Nivana
* George
* Millamer
* Adelle
* Beth
* Miles

## James

To me his role as the "little mad boy with his book of fairytales" and the token "zombie child" are iconic elements of Marloth.  James alone is probably the primary character making me want to have at least one more book revolving around children.

## Nivana

I have little interest in her as a child at this point.  Most of my ideas of her for the second book require her to be a young woman.

## George 

George is not that interesting as a child.  The very essence of his character is tied to the scientific world and he needs to be at least college age.

## Millamer

Millamer still has a lot of things I could still do with him as a child though all of that is optional.

## Adelle

From just about the very beginning I've fairly consistently skipped her later in the story until she is a young woman whether the others are children for a while or not.

## Beth

She's one of the least developed main characters and could go either way.

## Miles

Likewise, I'm not really sure what to do with Miles and could go either way with him.
