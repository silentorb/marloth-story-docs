# The Role of Non-Fantasy in Marloth

Some fiction is pure fantasy. Some fiction is pure non-fantasy. Some fiction is dual-layer, containing both a fantasy and non-fantasy layer.

Categorically, Marloth is primarily fantasy. The question of this article is how important it is to have a non-fantasy layer, especially for the start of the second book.

## Benefits of a Dual-Layer Setting

Here are the main reasons why a non-fantasy layer is valuable to a fantasy setting:

* It makes the fantastic more dramatic.

* It can add a sense of depth.

* It can be a metaphor for the carnal versus the spiritual.

* Non-fantasy is sometimes underappreciated, especially by people who prefer fantasy (like me).

* It can give characters that are aware of both layers a sense of transcendence.

## Types of Dual-Layer Settings:

* Non-fantastic with a splash of fantastic. (Most superhero comics)

* Separate worlds. (Narnia)

* Single world with two dimensions. (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)

* Possible Delusion. (American McGee's Alice)

## Fantastic Degrees

At the same time, pure fantasy settings can still have varying degrees of non-fantastic elements:

* Sparse fantasy. (The Wheels of Time)

* Extreme fantasy. (Xanth)

## Regarding Marloth: A Child's Fairytale

The first book alternated between a Possible Delusion setting and a Pure Fantasy setting that eventually forgets about the question of madness.

For the most part, the contrast between fantasy and non-fantasy did not exist outside of the question of madness, particularly whether James was mad.

There were a few poignant cases where the contrast was used to challenge the validity of the book of Marloth.

Really, the first book didn't capitalize on the fantasy/non-fantasy conflict much.  All this time I had it in my head that this was such a major conflict of the first book and it really wasn't.

Outside of the first part, non-fantasy was rarely used to accentuate fantasy.  It produced hardly any transcendence.  It added some sense of depth but that was still dwarfed by all of the other elements likewise adding a sense of depth.

## Regarding Further Literature

Now that it is established that this whole mechanic was not used as much in the first book as I had originally thought, that leaves the primary question of what role should non-fantasy play and the rest of the Marloth narrative?

Right off, the question is not whether Marloth should ever have sections of pure non-fantasy. I will always be open to that. The question is whether or not such sections are essential. For years I have been struggling under the assumption that a full-blown non-fantasy layer is essential.

Now I think I've come to the conclusion that it is not.  I'll address the benefits of non-fiction in order.

## Reasons Non-Fantasy is not Essential for Marloth

* It makes the fantastic more dramatic.

    * While it's nice to have high impact fantasy, that's not the main reason I write fantasy.  (The reasons why I do are another topic.) 

* It can add a sense of depth.

    * Marloth has enough depth.  I shouldn't be greedy.

* It can be a metaphor for the carnal versus the spiritual.

    * There are plenty of other metaphors for this as well.

* Non-fantasy is sometimes underappreciated, especially by people who prefer fantasy (like me).

    * This issue can be largely addressed by including ordinary elements in the fantasy setting.  For example, in the first book I went out of my way to emphasize preparing and eating meals.  Beth is the definitive character for this dimension of the setting.

* It can give characters that are aware of both layers a sense of transcendence.

    * Out of all the points in this list, this last is the most attractive to me. But at the same time, I'm not sure it's even the most healthy. It always bothered me how the Harry Potter series contained much effort to hide the wizarding world from the muggles.  Christian fantasy should be about revealing the magical side of reality, but it's hard to maintain the dual layers without the heroes devolving into an enlightened, mystical illuminati.  If Buffy or Harry wanted to, they could prove to the whole world that fantastic monsters are real, and the dual layer would be shattered, leaving only a pure-fantasy setting. Thus, the characters must live in contrived secrecy.  It might be possible to create a story that pulls off a dual-layer setting with heroes that strive to shatter it, but that would be a delicate balance and require the entire narrative to be built around this issue, something to far out of the way for Marloth.
     
There's one more note along these lines. I struggle a great deal with wanting to retreat into fantasy, and I find it important to write a narrative about these struggles. However, these struggles mean most in light of responsibility. Particularly adult responsibility. I think I could provide some powerful scenes of James wrestling with the ordinary world, but I realized today that such struggles would be meaningless until James is an adult. I'm certain there still more great narrative where the main characters are still children, and I'm not at the point for them to be adults yet. So if I am to further explore James wrestling with reality, I think that needs to be in a later book when he is older.

## Closing

I think my biggest takeaway is I've worried too much about the setting and not enough about the stories I actually want to tell.  Fantasy simply supports my style and mechanics better than non-fantasy.

Also, TWOLD has the option of being a setting where some people know magic exists but see it as bad.  That is a good compromise to still get some of the benefits of a dual-layer setting within a pure-fantasy setting.
