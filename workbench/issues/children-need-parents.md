# Children Need Parents

For TWOLD I find myself with a cast of child protagonists and a dilemma.  It feels increasingly irresponsible/unhealthy to have a story where children are on their own and do not have guardians.  But once guardians are introduced the children's decisions matter less.  The entire issue becomes whether or not they obey their parents, which can be interesting but is limited and not the story I currently have to tell.

I can think of five possible directions I can go:

1. Ignore guardians.
2. Find some middle-ground compromise.
3. Skip ahead until the children are young adults (already pushing close to that.)
4. Focus on children with strong guardians.  The main story becomes about obedience.
5. Focus on guardians.  Most of the child characters would take the background.

Let's explore those options:

## 1. Ignore Guardians

This can take two forms:

### Children vs. Adults

This is the part that can be fine for short periods but can also feed a spirit of rebellion and unsubmissiveness.  The first book got close to this but never got close enough for me to get real concerned.

### World where age doesn't matter much

This is where most of the first book landed.  The world was so surreal and metaphorical that age was mostly a stylistic distinction.  So far the second book has looked less dreamlike and less of a world that could support this approach.  But I've been considering making it more dreamlike.

## 2. Middle-Ground Compromise

This boils down to having guardians but the children still run off and have adventures on their own a lot.  I think this can subtly be as destructive as outright having children, but can also work well too.

Some examples:

* Harry Potter
    * Generally the adults are capable but leave the world-saving to the children.  Lots of rebellious attitude in how this is handled.

* Buffy the Vampire Slayer
    * Giles is helpful but mostly weak in a fight.  Parent's are either disconnected from any of the conflict or simply no help.

* Naruto
    * Children at times have to fight battles on their own but the setting is very comfortable with them largely submitting to adult leaders as well.  The story has a very strong and fleshed-out sense of generations.

This option seems to work the best when the setting has a strong sense of generations, something that so far is not Marloth's strength.  At this point I can either play off Marloth's current strengths or try to redefine it.  There are so many areas that aren't Marloth's strengths for now I'd lean toward just eventually creating some other setting with different strengths.

## 3. Skip ahead til the children are adults

I keep pushing the ages of the children just because so much of the storylines I want to tell are adult.  Currently I've increased the age gaps between them to cheat a little in this area.

By the third book I definitely see all the children being at least young adults.  Maybe this issue needs to be addressed more officially: Why is it so important to have children in the second book?

However, even if I went this route it would not completely remove the issue at hand, because even as young adults you still have elders that should be submitted to.  The first Marloth book simply has little sense of submission.  As was mentioned previously, it only avoided this issue by addressing so many other issues that it wasn't a problem.  The setting of the book was outside the scope of submission.  But I'm not sure I can maintain that setting.

## 4. Focus on children with strong guardians

I'm just not into this.  It reminds me of the feelings I never liked about the Narnia books which were full of protagonists doing the wrong thing and you know it's the wrong thing and it just feels awkward and disconnecting.

## 5. Focus on the Guardians

I don't think I have a good example of anyone doing this.  Some narrative's start of focusing on the children and later give the adults larger roles, but at best it's still a compromise.

I have some interesting adult characters lined up I could focus on but I'm afraid it just wouldn't feel like Marloth anymore.
