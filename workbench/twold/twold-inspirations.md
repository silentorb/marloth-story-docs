### Notes

* While each season of Stranger Things begins with independent agents, they always end with a unified team of heroes.
* Twin Peaks has a team of police but most of the heroes are not a part of that team.

## Survival Horror

* Tenkuu Shinpan
* Gantz
* The Walking Dead

* From that list we get:
  * Challenge
  * Ideological Disagreements
  * Injustice (Particularly when characters are silently waiting for vindication)
  * Isolation / Loneliness / Longing to band together with other characters
  * Mystery
  * Society in Chaos
  * Vulnerability/Desperation
* I don't want a passive hero
