# TWOLD Mental Map

## Overview

## Part 1

* People tend to ignore dependencies
* People tend to have a false sense of independence

* Evil forces are trying to sway people

## Part 3

* People need people
* Pharisees oppose strong Christians
* Pharisees repulse non-Christians
* Compassion is more important than survival
* You must worship your dependencies [ I don't know what I was thinking with that? ]
* Good people are tempted to do evil
* Compassion is a weakness without Godliness

## Part 4

* Evil people have a conscience that is still pricked

* Good cannot thrive without Godliness
* Without Godliness, evil thrives
* Good forces are trying to sway people
* Everyone worships something

## Part 5

* When a person rejects God, they are depending on evil

## Part 6

* God doesn't need anything
* Evil looks powerful yet is powerless
* There is no such thing as a super-powerful person without dependence on many people
* Everyone depends on God
  * It's not even a contest; he is sustaining everything and everyone

## Post-Climax Points

* Inside every heart is a war between good and evil
