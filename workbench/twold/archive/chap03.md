The doctor picked up the satchel and was surprised to find it heavier than it should be.   Reaching into the satchel, he took out a large, weathered book.

"Where did this come from?" he said to himself.



At eye height stood a stuffed animal barely two feet tall.  It was wielding a wooden club that was over three feet tall.

"Yeah," said Fugue, "I would be surprised too," and he bludgeoned the doctor unconscious.

The doctor had barely hit the ground when his assistant came rushing down the hallway, shouting at the stuffed creature in anger and amazement.

"Don't worry," said Fugue, dropping the club and drawing a pistol, "I won't kill you," and he shot the assistant in the side.

The young man screamed and stumbled back down the hall.
