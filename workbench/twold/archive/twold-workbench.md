# TWOLD Workbench

## Head

* Viewing things as problem-and-solution, I've been starting with the bad and trying to work my way to the good, but that approach is failing
  * With that approach, evil becomes the focus
  * I need to start with the good, and work my way backwards to the bad
  * I can still define high-level problems early on, but I shouldn't focus on the implementations of those problems
* The main focus of TWOLD is supposed to be dependence, but I have not yet defined what depending on God should look like symbolically

### Impetus

* From that list we get:
  * Challenge
  * Ideological Disagreements
  * Impending Doom
  * Injustice (Particularly when characters are silently waiting for vindication)
    * Longsuffering
  * Isolation / Loneliness / Longing to band together with other characters
  * Mystery
  * Society in Chaos
  * Vulnerability/Desperation
* I don't want a passive hero

## Biblical Inspiration

## Resolved

* James starting off as a slumbering giant?
  * Yes
