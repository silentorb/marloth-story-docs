# TWOLD Issues

## Pressing

* Who is the Christ character?  Is it Tralvorkemen or a new representation?
* How do you depict dependence on Christ?
* How do you depict spiritual warfare?
* TWOLD has sort of been an origin story.  Origin stories are awkward, and even more awkward when it's the second book.  Having the second book be an origin story suggests the first book went in the wrong direction.
  * The first book is also sort of an origin story, but also creates a sense of already existing
    * An example of this is Fugue
      * In a way he and James don't team up until half-way through the book, and at the same time Fugue is presented near the beginning as the orphan's mascot that already accompanies them on adventures
    * This fits with my dreams, which often have a tension of now-and-not yet, a feeling of how things should be and watching things slowly fall into place
      * That actually was a major theme of the first book
        * It was explicitly reiterated throughout.
    * Now-and-not yet doesn't go very far toward fixing how a second origin story really does indicate a jarring change in direction

## Backlog

- How is Jarvanis incorporated into the story?
- Who's the main gray hero?
