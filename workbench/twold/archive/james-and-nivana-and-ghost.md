Nivana pointed at the girl.  "Who is she?"

James was silent.

The girl smiled at Nivana, "Hello!  I'm Adelle!"

"No she's not," said James.

"Yes I am!" The girl hugged him from behind   "I'm Adelle!  The love of your life!  I want to spend the rest of eternity with you!"

"What is a girl doing in your cell?  No one would allow that."

"The doctor can't see her.  She's a ghost."

Nivana gasped.  "This is *Adelle's* ghost?"

"Yes," said the girl

"No.  Well, sort of," said James.

"So Adelle, the girl you were in love with . . . is she *dead?"*

"No, worse.  She's *married."*

*"What?"*

"I scoured the world for her, and when I found her, she was married.  To a prince of all things."

"So you're locked in a cell with a married woman?  You've been living together?"

"I'm not married!" said the girl, and then looking at James fondly, "at least not yet..."

"That's not Adelle!" said James, "People don't become ghosts.  Ghosts aren't people; ghosts *haunt* people."

"Okay, so this is a ghost.  I'm adjusting to that.  So how did you become haunted by a ghost?"

"I don't know!  Probably something to do with all the trauma."

"The trauma of discovering your friend is married?"

"Yes."

"Is she happy?"

"I don't know.  He probably beats her."

*"Really?"*

"No.  He seems to be a great guy.  It would just be nice if he beat her."

"Aww James!"  You can beat me anytime!" said the ghost.

Nivana rolled her eyes. "Coming here is starting to look like a mistake.  Whatever you do, don't you ever fall in love with me," and then under her breath, "*You little creep*."

\* \* \*

"You can cross between realities?"

"Sort of.  It's more art than science."

\*Â \* \*

"It's more than that.  I searched every connected dream I could get to for an alternate version of Adelle that was still single.  And guess what?  Every Adelle was married!  Every single one!"

"Ouch."

"And not only that, every time she was married to the same guy!  Each dream had its own version of prince charming."

"How many times did you go through this?  Wow are you not good at taking a hint."

"I thought I was supposed to keep trying!  I used to believe in true love.  That Adelle and I were destined for each other.  Eventually my hopes were dashed and I stopped believing."

"Well that's your own fault.  True love is rubbish and you were a fool to put weight on it."

"Oh, I believe in true love again.  It's real, and it hates me."

James looked at the floor.  "It exists to spite me.
