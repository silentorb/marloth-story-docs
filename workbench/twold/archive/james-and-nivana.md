* Restrain his zombie nature
* Find Adelle
* Apologetics
* Fight evil
* Write a book

#### Apologetics

Much of James' character is an apologist.  He stands up for truth and argues in its favor.  Even though he's reserved he has no problem stepping foward in a public forum.

At its heart, Marloth is a war for people's souls.  An essential part of that is what people believe.  Marloth is a battle for mind share.

* Influence

* Power, but only to assist her other desires
