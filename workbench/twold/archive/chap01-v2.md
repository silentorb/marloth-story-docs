Nivana awoke with a start.  She was lying in a strange bed in a strange room.  The room was nearly pitch black.  If it hadn't been for a trickle of light through a small, half-boarded window she would have been effectively blind.

She was not wearing a stitch of clothes.

...

Articles of clothing were scattered about the room.  They did not look familiar, but she [tried them on] and was surprised to find they fit her well.

...

Then there were the voices.  Through the walls echoed muffled screams of agony.  All the voices of women.

...

[ In the hall]

Nivana jolted.  There was a middle-aged woman in front of her.  But that was not what had startled her.

A pair of curling goat's horns protruded from the woman's head.

------

Two men were walking down a street of the City of Orphans.  It was a dangerous street, but they were capable men.

"I want to form a team.  A group of skilled individuals to fight evil. I want you to join me.  Together, we could do anything."

"Not quite anything."

"Well close enough.  So what do you say?  Are you ready for more action?"

"I like to hope war is behind me.  My wife and I want to start an inn."

"Well will you at least send my way any able-bodied individuals you come across?"

"That may go against my conscience."

"Whatever do you mean?"

[ Is it possible to be both politely evasive and firmly straightforward here? ]

------

"How did you get here?!?"

"I gave nearly all of the money I had to a talking animal.  In return he provided me information."

...

When George turned around, not only the door but entire tree was gone.

------

Nivana suddenly found herself standing in a large, elegant room with a staircase along one of its walls.  She had no memory of how she had arrived there or what had happened.

And something had definitely happened.

Nivana looked down at her hands.  They were covered in blood.  Blood was all around her, adorning the furniture, walls, and some even dripping from the ceiling.  But mostly it was adorning the bodies.

The bodies.  Somehow she knew she had murdered them.

She slowly turned in a circle, soaking in her surroundings.  There must have been at least a dozen bodies.  Some of the cases were [hard/difficult/impossible] to quantify.

*Is this real?* She thought to herself. *Is this really* me*?*

...

*I'm a monster!*

The journal of George Hurley

I have taken up a part time position assisting at the Asylum [after my studies]

One of the more peculiar patients is a child.  His name is James.  His file states that he has been here for quite some time, though he claims he [only] just returned here recently.

But that is only half of what makes James interesting.  The other half is another patient.  Further down the hall is young girl of about the same age.  They are the only children I know of in this Asylum.  The name in her file is Jane Doe, which she herself says is not her name, though she has never provided me with another.

The striking feature of this girl is she knows James.  When she first spoke his name I figured it must be coincidence, but as time has progressed there is no question the James she speaks of is the very same James [up/down] the hall.

[And] she speaks of him constantly.  It is difficult for her to speak of anything else.  Evidently the boy is at least a part of her condition.  [She speaks as though he is the reason for her existence.]

When I went to visit the girl today, I was surprised to find she was gone.  I looked into the matter and could not get a [straight answer] as to where she had been moved to.  This place is [terribly] disorganized; they claim to have misplaced her records and that they will let me know once anything turns up.

I am beginning to suspect they are hiding something.

\* \* \*

Today the head doctor of the Asylum met with me about the girl.  He claimed there had never been such a patient.  I said there must be some mistake.  Seeing how much the cases had been related, I asked him if he would tell me that the boy had also never been a patient.  To this the doctor [shook his head], saying that James was actually a well known case and had caused multiple disturbances in the past.

[ Osmand approaches Nivana on a grassy knoll not far from the Manor and proposes to her ]

"I cannot due to your unfortunate birth."

"What?  You are mistaken!  My birth is in every way superior to yours.  My father is of higher rank, my family is of greater renown and influence.  My fortune is vastly beyond your own."

"[...] you were born a lout.  I do not hold you responsible for it.  You did not choose such a birth.  You have my pity.  It was Sovereign will that you be born a lout, and that will haunt you the rest of your life."

[ Osmand hits her and knocks her to the ground ]

"How dare you?" Nivana hissed.

"I dare, because I can.  Go ahead and make a fuss.  See what your father can conjure.  He may be a lord, but my father is a god!  I can do with you as I please.  I could make love to you right now if I liked, if you hadn't suddenly turned so repulsive."

"That is an excellent aspiration and I am fully behind our home being such a place someday, but not tonight."
