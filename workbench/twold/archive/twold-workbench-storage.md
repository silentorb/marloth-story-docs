## Prose

"You have a large cistern.  You could hold more magic than three of my girls.  Very valuable."

"So I have the job?"

"No, I'm not giving you any job."

"What?  That doesn't make any sense!  Why won't you hire me?"

"Because word's gotten around/about that you can use magic.  You're an empty gun, and no one's fool enough to fill/load you."



"Hey!  Hey!  Before this place is [further smashed / smashed any more], will someone get me a martini?"

[ Later on: ]

[So-and-so] stepped forward, martini in hand.
