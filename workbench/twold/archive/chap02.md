The Collector sniffed the air.

"I smell a rare kind of magic.  Something ancient.  Something primordial."

He lingered on the thought and then said suddenly, "Line up the girls immediately!  I must see what wonders you have in store!"

The Collector threw open the door and strode into the room.  Adelle looked up.

"She's empty!", said the Collector.

"Excuse me?", said Adelle.

"She's not one of my girls," said the Merchant.

"But what is this?" said the Collector, "Residue was evident from the other side of the building!  She must have contained an unfathomable volume of magic!"

"I did have magic once, but I discarded it."

"Lies!  No one *discards* magic!  Obviously someone took it.  Someone powerful."

He turned to the Merchant.  "How much will you take for her?"

"He doesn't own me," said Adelle.

"She's right.  I don't own her."

The Collector turned back to Adelle and examined her thoughtfully.  "We can work something out"

"I'm not for sale!"

The Collector turned to leave.  "Come, [Merchant's name], let us return to the others.  Later we can speak more of this."

"If you stand there I *will* hurt you!  Move out of the way!"

"No!"

Banging started against the hall door.

"I don't have time for this!", Nivana hissed.

She threw Beth across the room.  Except that's not what happened.  Nothing happened.  Nivana gestured furiously and Beth did not budge.

Nivana was confounded.  She did not have much time to adjust.  Beth stepped forward and punched Nivana in her pretty face.  And then punched her again.  And then a third time.

Nivana fell over backwards and the world faded into shadow.

"We're not here to protect you.  We're here to protect *us*.  Sending any fewer men would be suicide."

------

"Yeah, I think that was a... stage name."

Suddenly a half-formed memory returned to Nivana.  She was giving a presentation to a small crowd, and Millamer was passing by, and their eyes met, and she recognized him and he recognized her.  He started to laugh, and she was mortified, and she no longer knew why.  Something about magic.
