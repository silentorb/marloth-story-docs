On the edge of a dream, beside beds of sleeping memories, a boy a girl walked along a moonlit path.

"Are you dead?"

"I don't know."



The boy was a zombie.  The girl was a ghost.


"Maybe I should consult the book."

"You don't have time to read that!  You have to find me first!"

    Gets into trouble and is rescued by Drenodir and his men.

"You do realize it's evil, don't you?  It's only here to feed on your zombie energy."

"What?  The girl?"

"That's no girl.  It's a Visage.  It's whatever you want to see."


"You need a home."


"I would tell you to destroy her but it's not that simple."

"She would still haunt you, but she would be less tangible."


"Maybe I am dead.  Maybe you will never find my body.  Maybe this is the most you will ever have of me."

"I don't want to give up.  Not yet."

"James, you're tired.  Who knows how much time has elapsed outside, but in this dream you have been searching for a lifetime.  You need a break.  You need *me*."

For the first in a long time, James looked at her.  She was so beautiful.


    James awakes to find Adelle's dead body beside him.  
    
James reached out but she dissolved into dust.
