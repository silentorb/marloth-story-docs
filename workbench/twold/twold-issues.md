# TWOLD Issues

## Pressing

* Who is the Christ character?  Is it Tralvorkemen or a new representation?
* How do you depict dependence on Christ?
* How do you depict spiritual warfare?
* What is the plot to weaken the Christ character?
  * Should this still be included?  It's starting to look like a rehash of the end of the first book, and the lawlessness mechanic in the original Shadowhood.
  * Part of the problem with this story idea is it's extreme and global.  I've increasingly found such devices to be brittle and overbearing.  They give less than they appear to and put restrictions on the rest of the story.  Usually a similar end can be achieved with smaller, more light-weight solutions.
* TWOLD has sort of been an origin story.  Origin stories are awkward, and even more awkward when it's the second book.  Having the second book be an origin story suggests the first book went in the wrong direction.
  * The first book is also sort of an origin story, but also creates a sense of already existing.
    * An example of this is Fugue.  In a way he and James don't team up until half-way through the book, and at the same time Fugue is presented near the beginning as the orphan's mascot that already accompanies them on adventures.
    * This fits with my dreams, which often have a tension of now-and-not yet, a feeling of how things should be and watching things slowly fall into place.
      * That actually was a major theme of the first book.  It was explicitly reiterated throughout.
  * In the case of TWOLD, some aspects of origin can be achieved similar to the classic rom-com situation of a character (in this case we'll use a female protagonist to simplify clarity) who wants to marry a particular guy who doesn't love her but in the end realizes this other guy who all along has been her best friend is the one she should marry.
    * Part of this is achieved through slight of hand in juggling dimensions.  The first relationship involves the spice of romance like dating and intimacy, while the second relationship involves the meat of romance like supporting and caring for each other.  The narrative presents spice as the most desirable thing, and then reveals that the meat is more important and can be accompanied with spice. (The meat is foundational.  It's easier to add spice to meat than to add meat to spice.)

## Backlog

- How to include Drenodir in adventures without overshadowing the youths?
- How is Jarvanis incorporated into the story?
- Who's the main gray hero?
- Who is the seemingly invincible enemy?
