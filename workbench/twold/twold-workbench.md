# TWOLD Workbench

## Head

* Making Adelle a major character starting in the second part?
* Need solidified villains and threats!
  * A kaleidoscope of deluded world views
* At least initially, focusing on endangered comfort as the source of desperation instead of the wilderness
  * The same sort of vulnerability and fear that arises from terrorism
    * Which in turn creates paranoia, which adds more to be feared

### Impetus

* From that list we get:
  * Challenge
  * Ideological Disagreements
  * Impending Doom
  * Injustice (Particularly when characters are silently waiting for vindication)
  * Isolation / Loneliness / Longing to band together with other characters
  * Mystery
  * Society in Chaos
  * Vulnerability/Desperation
* I don't want a passive hero
* Society in Chaos will appear later

## Biblical Inspiration

## Resolved

* James starting off as a slumbering giant?
  * Yes
