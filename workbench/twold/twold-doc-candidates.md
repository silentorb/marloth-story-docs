# TWOLD Documentation Candidates

## Summaries

* TWOLD is a class story.  Less of a class conflict than a class contrast.  Two forms of evil, one privileged and one desperate, with the forces of good trapped in the middle.

## Survival Horror

### Genre Requirements

* Must be over a significant enough period of time to require sustainance and not just avoiding dangers
  * That is what Surival as a genre normally means.  Robinson Crusoe is a classic survival story.
  * This rules out many horror movies where characters are required to survive some monster over the course of a single night.
* Ordinary people are not exempt from regularly facing the horrors
  * In other words, survival horror takes place in a world where most people live ordinary lives and only heroes and occasional unfortunates have run-ins with horrors
  * This is half of the point and appeal of survival horror: to see what ordinary people do when weighed down by extraordinary conditions
    * Putting a variety of characters under the same pressures to see the contrasting responses
  * Some characters can be distanced from the survival but it should not be because they are extraordinary, not ordinary
* The majority of characters are either victims, oppressors, or both
  * The victimization here is being trapped in the horrific world
  * This rules out narratives like Darkest Dungeon where most of the characters willingly throw themselves at the horrors

### Calamity

#### Rules

* Calamity should not be random
* Calamity should be tied to inability and mistakes

#### Reasons

* Random calamity distances the audience.  Calamity tied to character failure is more engaging
* While random calamity can be disheartening and thus horrific, so can self-inflicted calamity
