# Setting Game Inspirations

## Overview

A list of games that are primary definitions for the kind of setting, geography, and experience of traversing Marloth

The main question to ask is "What games do I want to just hang out in as a world?"

This list is not so concerned about story, plot, or how fun the gameplay is.

For example, American McGee's Alice is one of Marloth's biggest influences, yet very little of that game is a place I would want to hang out in.  The whole game is designed to be something the player passes through.

This list is also focusing on games that don't just create a cool setting, but provide a good example of a holistic setting, where all of the pieces of the setting are connected together or at least have a sense of connection.

Part of the purpose for this list is to see if there's a way to channel a little of my passion for developing a particular kind of game (which hasn't panned out very well) instead into story writing.
