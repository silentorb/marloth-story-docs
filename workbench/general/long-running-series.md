# Long-running series

Within the context of this document, I'm defining a long-running series as either a television show that contains more than one season, a book or movie series that contains more than three installments, or a narrative franchise.  The important distinction here is that the series is running long enough to no longer cleanly fit into a three-act storyline.  Trilogies are being ruled out because each book of a trilogy can be loosely divided into a three act structure.  When more than three books are involved, such a division can no longer be cleanly employed.

For a narrative to have significant longevity and endurance, it needs a good framework for each of it's installments.

A narrative framework faces a similar need for balance that a standardized protocol faces.  If a narrative framework is too narrow and specific, its installment will be formulaic and shallow (It won't be able to support a variety of stories).  If the framework is too thin and lacks constraint, each installment will have to reinvent the wheel and the narrative will struggle to maintain both continuity and consistency (The thinner the framework, the closer the series is to having no framework).

At least for now it will be useful to examine some examples of long-running series

## Franchises

In general, series make for better franchise origins than one-off installments.  In other words, radio serials, television shows, and comic books series are a better medium to start a franchise than a book or movie.

### The Star Wars Movie Franchise

The Star Wars franchise has a horrible mess of a narrative framework.  It was never designed to be a narrative franchise.  It became a merchandise franchise before it was a narrative franchise.

The first Star Wars movie has a well constructed story with a variety of quality parts that all fit together in a neat package.  With the Exception of "The Empire Strikes Back", every Star Wars movie after the first has either cloned the original formula or had a flimsy story.  The second star wars movie is an oddity not only within the Star Wars franchise but outside of it as well for having a really weak and off-beat foundation yet working far better than it should due to excellent ideas and execution.

### The James Bond Movie Franchise

This franchise is formulaic, and fully embraces being formulaic.  The result is movies that are repetitive and shallow, but also stable.  You know what to expect from a Bond movie, and they can keep churning out Bond movies 'til the end of time.

### The Star Trek Movie and TV Franchise

Star Trek has a solid, well-designed narrative foundation.  This foundation is derived from a rich heritage of previous successful serials in other genres, particularly westerns.

Some of the constraints of its foundation are:

* A space ship that carries a team of characters
* A singular captain who is a strong and charismatic leader
* Exploring new planets and meeting new alien races
* A commitment to diplomacy before war
* Forums for philosophical and ethical discussion
