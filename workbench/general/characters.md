### Lord Mediev

Originally I planned on him being one of the most powerful wizards in the world, but like most superlatives I am scaling it back because it causes more problems than it is worth.

Now he is a capable but subtle magic user.  Instead of being found out to be a wizard through some dramatic public display like throwing fireballs to protect someone, he will instead be framedâ€”magical items will be found in his possession.  They are not his items, he was framed.  Somehow there is proof that he was framed and Nivana is aware of this proof, but the proof is somehow destroyed.  Later on it is revealed that even though he was framed, he actually *is* a magic user.

It's amazing how often the less-spectacular can be more interesting as well as practical.

Many females in Marloth wrestle with their role in relation to men, but none more than Nivana.  She is smart and confident, and hates living in a world run by men.  At the same time, her aggressive nature is almost masculine, and sometimes cripples her feminine sensibilities.  She wants to dominate men, but at the same time a small part of her wants to be loved and protected by men.
