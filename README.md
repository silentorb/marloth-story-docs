# Marloth Narrative Documentation

## Introduction

This document documents the process for Marloth documentation.  If the Marloth documentation is the story's meta, then this document is the meta-meta.

## Project Structure

The Marloth narrative project is divided into three layers:

1. Books
2. Documentation
3. Workbench

### Books

The final published narratives.  The books are currently maintained outside of this repository.

### Documentation

The documents are a collection of polished articles outlining:

1. Rules for Marloth books
2. The reasons for those rules

The rules exist to provide definition and consistency to the narratives.  Documenting the reasoning behind a rule helps protect it.

Sometimes I forget why I made a decision and throw out that decision, only to rediscover the reasons for why I originally made that decision, usually after much redundant effort.  A documented rule can still be later changed, but at least it will be changed while considering the original reasons for that rule.

The docs folder is a living, growing document, but at any given time should be fairly polished and generally presentable.

The docs should be written with the mindset that they may be published and read by a general audience.  This stance provides two benefits:

1. Even if I end up the only reader of this documentation, it is helpful to disassociate myself and not populate it with assumptions of personal context.  This makes the documentation cleaner for me to revisit at later times.
2. This documentation may prove of interest to others some day and be worth publishing.

### Workbench

The workbench is

* A place for temporary notes
* A scratch pad
* A staging area
* A place for maintaining todo lists

The primary reasons for the workbench is

* To keep rough ideas out of the docs until they are refined
* To provide a place for disposable text

Everything in the workbench is disposable.  Once a body of text in the workbench has served its purpose, it is either migrated to a book, migrated to the docs, or deleted.

The workbench is the primary entry point for new ideas.

## Documentation Rules

### Rules

* Never refer to particular narratives other than Marloth narratives
  * Other narratives can be referred to from material in the workbench
* Instead, the valuable insights a narrative provides should be extracted and melted down into a polished digest.  That way those insights can be included in the Marloth documentation without direct reference to the narratives they came from.

### Reasons

* I used to love focusing on particular inspirations to help drive Marloth development, but have gradually found that to be counter-productive.  The problem is that narratives are too raw of a material to be used directly.
