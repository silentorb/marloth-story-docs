# Marloth Narrative Design and Development

## Overview

These pages are an experiment to use basic web principles to organize and connect ideation, design, development, publication and documentation of Marloth stories

## Motivation

The information age has brought a paradigm shift to media.  The boundaries of where one product ends and the next begins, of when a product is ready for consumption, when it is finished, and what is and isn't the meta-product are all being challenged and stretched.

The nature of ideas, their packaging, and their consumption hasn't changed, just the conventions that happened to work well for centuries are becoming less effective for emerging trends.

The biggest change is information is now more fluid.
