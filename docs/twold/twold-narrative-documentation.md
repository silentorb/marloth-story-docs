# TWOLD Documentation

## Synopsis

TWOLD is a survival horror fantasy story.

## Overview

One of the challenges of TWOLD is it's not simply an attempt for lightning to strike twice.  It's a transition between a lightning strike and a perpetual lightning storm.  It's an attempt to turn a book into a franchise.  The first book relies heavily on one-off mechanics that do not perform well with repeated use.  TWOLD doesn't simply need to recapture the essence of the first book using fresh one-off mechanics, it needs to recapture the essence of the first book using mechanics that can perform well across any number of books.  TWOLD can still contain some fresh, one-off mechanics, but those need to be minimized.

The challenge of TWOLD is to bring stability to a setting that thrives on instability.
